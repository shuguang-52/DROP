Apologies for the confusion. Here's the corrected table with the metrics properly aligned:

| Image Size | Method | Rank-1 | mAP  |
|------------|--------|--------|------|
| 256*128    | BPBreID| 73.9   |  62.0|
|            | DROP   | 76.8   | 63.3 |
| 384*128    | BPBreID| 75.1   | 62.5 |
|            | DRIP   | 77.3   | 63.4 |
